#####*A simple chess app*

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span title="Java" class="pict-prog-java fa-2x"> </span>Java</p>



I created this little project in my spare time the summer after first year to reinforce some of the lessons that I'd learnt at the time, particularly inheritance.

Here is an image of the app as is with the move lines on display:

In the future I intend to in the future implement some of the following features into this little app:

- Endgame rules
- Saving your game/loading from previously saved game
- Simple UI (later perhaps more complex UI)
- Better graphics interface
