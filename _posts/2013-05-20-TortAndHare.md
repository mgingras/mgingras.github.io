#####*A simulation of the age old tale - The Tortoise and the Hare*

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span title="C++" class="pict-prog-cplusplus fa-3x"></span></p>



This project is split out to follow the MVC principles and is wholly written in C++ with the view rendered using the Curses C++ {libraryexcerpt_separator}.

<!-- abridge -->

When this program is executed a simulation of a tortoise, represented by '```@```', and hare, represented by '```^```', race up your
terminal or "to the peak of a mountain."


In order for it to run optimally and be entertaining I recommend running the game in a maximized Terminal window, however it will function in any sized window.

Instructions:

1. To compile this project, open a terminal in the cloned directory and type "```make```"
2. This will compile and link all required files code.
3. Once compiled and linked enter "```./race```" to execute the binary, after which follow the on-screen instructions.
