A game played over TCP/IP sockets where players take turns guessing each other's word. Once the game has started
interrupts are blocked by the game until there is a winner. 

<!-- abridge -->

Only then does the winner have the choice to leave. The
loser however is stuck in the game until they win (or kill the process from another terminal).

In order to play this game:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open a terminal window at that directory and enter "```Make```"
3. To play as the server/host just execute the binary "```./probe```"
4. To play as the client/connect to the server, execute the binary with the command line argument of their ip address (i.e. "```./probe 194.153.205.26```")

From there just follow the on screen instructions and enjoy.
