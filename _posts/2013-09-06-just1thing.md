#####*Promoting mental health and encouraging small changes individuals can do to improve their own*

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span title="JavaScript" class="pict-prog-js02 fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="jquery" class="pict-prog-jquery fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="HTML5" class="pict-html5-01 fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="CSS3" class="pict-css3-01 fa-2x"> </span></p>

I created this site, using Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap, as the focal point for a potential neuroscience campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to promote mental health awareness and to suggest small changes that individuals could accomplish that would contribute to improving their own mental health.

This site is one portion of a campaign that spans Twitter, Facebook and a poster campaign.
