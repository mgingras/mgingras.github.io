####How Bell Canada stole my money

Dear Mr. Cope and Mr. Arbour,

I am a Bell customer and was billed $627.32 on October 23rd, 2014, $467.93 over my actual bill.

On October 18th I received an email stating that my new balance was $627.32, astronomically higher than my typical monthly bill. I quickly called Bell service to remedy the issue. Fortunately they were able to determine that the amount was due to an error transferring plans for one of the phone numbers on my account, and claimed that they were able to fix the overfilling on my account. However, since the issue arose so close to the date it would be billed against the pre-authorized credit card on the account, if I wanted to avoid being charged the original (incorrect) balance, I would have to cancel my pre-authorized credit and pay manually once the correction was applied to the account. I went ahead and removed my pre-authorized payments from my account. On October 23rd, $627.32 was charged to my credit card despite having withdrawn authorization for Bell to charge this amount.

I soon noticed the issue and followed up with Bell customer service. They informed me that there was nothing they could do now that the money had been charged except to credit it to my account. I objected, and they finally agreed to make the payment as a cheque with a few caveats. Firstly, they would only issue it to Joanna Armbruster, my mother and initial account holder, who had assisted me in getting my cell phone up and running and has not been involved in paying for over 5 years. Secondly, it would take 21+ days for them to process the payment. I am fortunate enough not to be living paycheque to paycheque and can make it without that $467.93 for three weeks. However, for many in North America $467.93 equates to most of a paycheque or rent for the month. I am also on good terms with my mother, so having her cash the cheque and transfer the funds to me wouldnâ€™t be a huge inconvenience; this is also not the case for everyone. Evidently, the two conditions imposed by Bell for reimbursing money they wrongfully charged my account were inconvenient and incredibly presumptuous. 

I waited patiently for the cheque to arrive; it never did. On December 5th, another anomaly on my account caused me to call into Bell, at which point I requested that the cheque be re-issued. Now, almost three months since the original charges, I am once again on the phone with Bell. There is still no apparent resolution in sight and the only action the customer service representative I spoke to claimed to be capable of doing was sending an email to their refund department and potentially cutting me another cheque.

I am frustrated. I am out nearly $500 and many hours of wasted time on the phone with your company. In my eyes, Bell has stolen my money and is not providing me with the customer service that is expected of a large corporation entrusted by thousands of Canadians. I do not know what else to do at this point.

I hope you can help.

Thanks,

Martin Gingras
