####My old site
#####*My old personal website for sharing my projects, insights, and experiences*

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span title="JavaScript" class="pict-prog-js02 fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="jquery" class="pict-prog-jquery fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="HTML5" class="pict-html5-01 fa-2x"> </span>&nbsp;<span title="CSS3" class="pict-css3-01 fa-2x"> </span></p>

The site was created using Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I had a great experience with both Jekyll and GitHub. I learnt a few neat things in my experience making this site that will help me moving forward.

Some awesome things I learnt making this site include responsive design, static html email forms, random JavaScript hacks, and much more. If you want to see what I managed to create, check out the source code for the site [here](https://github.com/mgingras/The-old-mgingras.ca)
