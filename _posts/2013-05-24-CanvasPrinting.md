This is a basic mock up of a potential web commerce website written with HTML, CSS, and modest JS with a PHP back end communicating with a MySQL database.

<!-- abridge -->

The purpose of this site is to demonstrate a simple photo gallery/canvas printing website with some basic features:

- Dynamic photo gallery that users can upload their own pictures
- Create an account and make order
- When in the shopping cart, final price will dynamically change based on the dimensions of the order
- Track past orders
