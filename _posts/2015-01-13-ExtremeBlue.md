####My Summer internship at IBM

I spent the past summer as an [Extreme Blue](http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/) technical intern at [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/ca/en/). This program is separate from IBM's other internships in that instead of joining an existing team working on an existing product, either under development or in market, we are tasked with creating a brand new product from scratch. In addition to the technical aspects associated with this, we are expected to perfect a pitch which we have to present monthly to senior leadership within IBM Canada, before heading down to IBM's headquarters in Armonk, NY to present to their executives there.

How the process within IBM works is, in the fall the year prior to the program, IBMers around the world submit project proposals to the program leadership. These projects are then filtered based on their alignment with IBM's current strategic vision, their technical feasibility, and the level of innovation they represent. Resumes submitted are then reviewed and applicants with skillsets matching the proposed projects are selected to interview. Past Extreme Blue alumni within IBM are then called upon to perform the first round of interview, since they are most qualified to determine whether an individual is a good fit for this role, after which subsequent rounds of interviewing are conducted by the team leaders who submitted the project proposal. As an example of successful projects, last year there were five in Canada, one investigating the application of IBM's analytic capabilities towards healthcare, two targeted at using various approaches to leverage GPU acceleration, one that wanted to create a faster mathematical computational language?, and lastly, the project I was recuited to, a project to create an SaaS product that leveraged IBM's existing Social Media Analytics engine to publish analytic data as through an API.
